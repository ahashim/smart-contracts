# Critter

An open source peer-to-peer microblogging NFT platform for EVM compatible blockchains.

**Core concepts**:

- Every address is a unique username.
- Every post (called a squeak) is an NFT.
- Squeaks can be bought & sold via a bidding price discovery mechanism.
- Once the author sells their squeak, the ownership is transferred.
- Actions (such as "favorites" & "resqueaks") cost a fee.
- Fees are paid out to the **owner** of said squeak.
- Only owners can delete squeaks.
- Deleting a squeak costs a fee of `blocks elapsed x deletion fee`.

<!-- TODO: setup hosting when working on the client -->
<!-- Visit [https://critter.fyi](https://critter.fyi) to start squeaking on the blockchain. -->

## Local Development

###### **Requirements**:

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org) version `^14.8.2`.
- Create an `.env` file in the project root with the following info:

```
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<your-etherscan-api-key>
PRIVATE_KEY=<your-ethereum-account-private-key>
REPORT_GAS="true" # comment this line out to turn off Gas reporting during test runs
ROPSTEN_URL=<your-ropsten-network-api-url>
```

The following commands will allow you to compile & run the contracts on a [local hardhat network](https://hardhat.org).

##### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

##### Compile contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

##### Start JSON-RPC node

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

##### Open hardhat console

```bash
npx hardhat console
```

## Testing

##### Unit Tests

```bash
npx hardhast test
```

You can increase test performance by skipping the transpilation step of the test files by setting the `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=1` environment variable:

```bash
TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=1 npx hardhast test
```

##### Code Coverage

A code coverage report can be generated by running:

```bash
npx hardhat coverage
```

## Project Roadmap

- [x] ERC721 interface compatability.
- [x] Account creation/update & validation.
- [x] Sqeak creation/deletion & validation.
- [ ] Account funding via ERC-20 compatible tokens.
- [ ] Squeak actions + pricing:
  - Favorite
  - Dislike
  - Resqueak
- [ ] Media support for squeaks via IPFS (images, video, documents, etc&hellip;).
- [ ] Implement basic moderation status on account structs:
  - Active
  - Suspended
  - Shadow Banned
  - Banned
- [ ] Auction mechanism to bid on posted squeaks
  - Ideally [Vickrey auctions](https://github.com/JoWxW/Vickrey-Auction/blob/master/contracts/VickreyAuction.sol).
- [ ] Harden contract with [security best practices](https://consensys.net/blog/developers/solidity-best-practices-for-smart-contract-security/).
- [ ] Fuzz testing with [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna).
- [ ] Deploy to an EVM compatible layer 2 solution such as the [zkSync testnet](https://portal.zksync.io/).
