# Critter

An open source microblogging NFT platform for Ethereum.

**Core concepts**:

- Every address is a unique username.
- Every post (called a squeak) is an NFT.
- Squeaks can be bought & sold via a bidding price discovery mechanism.
- Once the author sells their squeak, the ownership is transferred.
- Actions (such as "favorites" & "resqueaks") cost a fee.
- Fees are paid out to the **owner** of said squeak.
- Only owners can delete squeaks.
- Deleting a squeak costs a fee of `blocks elapsed x deletion fee`.

## Local Development

###### **Requirements**:

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org) version `^14.8.2`.
- Create an `.env` file in the project root with the following info:

```
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<your-etherscan-api-key>
PRIVATE_KEY=<your-ethereum-account-private-key>
REPORT_GAS="true" # comment this line out to turn off Gas reporting during test runs
ROPSTEN_URL=<your-ropsten-network-api-url>
```

The following commands will allow you to compile & run the contracts on a [local hardhat network](https://hardhat.org).

##### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

##### Compile contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

##### Start JSON-RPC node

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

##### Open hardhat console

```bash
npx hardhat console
```

## Testing

##### Unit Tests

```bash
npx hardhast test
```

You can increase test performance by skipping the transpilation step of the test files by setting the `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=1` environment variable:

```bash
TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=1 npx hardhast test
```

##### Code Coverage

A code coverage report can be generated by running:

```bash
npx hardhat coverage
```
